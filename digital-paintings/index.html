          <p class="painting-description">
                This painting is inspired by the characterization of Mephistopheles in Franz Liszt's 
                "Mephisto Waltz No. 1, S. 514", using dynamic shapes and vibrant colors to convey the 
                music's diabolical and passionate nature in contrast to the loveless and 
                masochistic main character, in a visually symbolic manner, emphasizing both emotion and movement.

          <p class="painting-description">
            Inspired by Rachmaninoff's "The Isle of the Dead, Op. 29" this painting captures 
            the somber and mysterious atmosphere of the symphonic poem with a scene set in a dark, 
            tranquil sea leading to the eerie and desolate island, reflecting the haunting 
            beauty and existential contemplation evoked by the music.

            This painting is inspired by Eric Whitacre's "Lux Aurumque", capturing the ethereal 
            and transcendent quality of the music with a scene set in a surreal, celestial 
            landscape bathed in soft, golden light, embodying the theme of light and purity.

            This abstract painting is inspired by Morten Lauridsen's "O Magnum Mysterium", 
            capturing the ethereal and spiritual essence of the music through an interplay of light and shadow, 
            with swirls of deep blues and purples contrasted by bursts of gold and white light, 
            embodying the profound mystery and reverence conveyed in the choral work.
